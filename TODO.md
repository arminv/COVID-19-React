## Ideas/ToDo:

- Move sorting into a function (in LineChart)
- Add death as % of total in tooltips (make sure there is no double counting data!)
- Show total cases as % of: population (need another API), tested, etc.
- Add links to social media/GitHub & credit at the bottom of page
- Add image on page
- ~~Sort historical chart (of different countries) in a descending order~~
- ~~Replace 'Loading...' with a UI component from Material-UI~~
- ~~Add favicon~~
- ~~Get the complete history for each country and show it as a chart (total, deaths, tests over time - one chart)~~
