**Ideas:**

- Show total cases as % of: population (need another API), tested, etc.
- Sort historical chart (of different countries) in a descending order
- Replace 'Loading...' with a UI component from Material-UI
- Add links to social media/GitHub & credit at the bottom of page
- ~~Get the complete history for each country and show it as a chart (total, deaths, tests over time - one chart)~~
